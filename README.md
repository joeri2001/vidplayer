### How to use
1. You take a video file, and drag it into the "Select or Drop video file" section.
2. You take the .srt file for this video, and drag it into the "Select or Drop subtitle file" section.
3. You adjust the subtitle offset if it doesn't play in sync with the subtitle offset buttons.


#### Optional
- Download and setup [Yomitan](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setupYomitanOnPC/) to get imediate translations on the subtitles when you need them (pressing shift while hovering text) instead of having to copy paste to an online dictionary.
